# PI-Data-Analysis

A comprehensive repository containing scripts, methodologies, and derivations for Pinto Protocol data analysis. This repository serves as a reference for understanding how various protocol metrics, calculations, and insights are derived from raw blockchain data.

## Purpose

This repository documents the analytical processes used to:
- Extract and process Pinto Protocol data from various sources
- Derive meaningful metrics and calculations from raw data
- Provide reproducible methodologies for data analysis
- Archive the computational logic behind protocol insights

## Structure

Each analysis is organized into its own directory with:
- **Scripts**: Automated data processing and calculation tools
- **Methodologies**: Documentation of analytical approaches
- **Derivations**: Mathematical and logical foundations for calculations
- **Results**: Generated datasets and findings

## Contributing

When adding new analyses, ensure:
1. Clear documentation of data sources and assumptions
2. Reproducible scripts with proper dependencies
3. Explanation of calculation methodologies
4. Version control of both code and derived data
